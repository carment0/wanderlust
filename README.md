# Wanderlust
**Wanderlust is a collaborative mobile app that allows users to plan out an itinerary realtime utilizing a chat room and a Google map.**

## Background/Overview
It is sometimes difficult to plan out trips with people when they are located elsewhere. Unlike existing travel planning apps, Wanderlust aims to make it easier to plan trips with friends and family by creating a live chat room with a Google map that updates when users place markers.

## Functionality & MVP
This app, at a minimum, will satisfy the following MVPs:
- [ ] Users can sign up and sign in using authentication
- [ ] Users can see all of their trips on dashboard view
- [ ] CRUD functionality for trips and entities (chatrooms, markers, etc.)
- [ ] Users can instant message each other in a chatroom
- [ ] Production README
- [ ] Demo website for the mobile app

### Bonus
- [ ] Dropdown navigation
- [ ] Users can view travel time between markers
- [ ] App hosted on iOS/Android app stores

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
This mobile app will be created using Google Firebase, React Native, and Redux which will allow for rapid prototyping.
- Google Firebase will allow us to utilize different OAuths such as Facebook and Google authorization.
- Google Firebase will also allow to render a map and a chatroom.

The technical challenges for this application are:
- Learning a whole new framework (Firebase)
- Connecting Firebase with React Native/Redux and managing uni- and bi- directional flow of data.
- Creating an intuitive and bug-free UI for the users.

### React Native
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- React Native allows us to build cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React/Redux.

### Firebase
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Firebase is a mobile and web application platform that provides the architecture for cloud messaging, authorization, and realtime database.

### Google Map/Places API
[Google Map/Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
- Google Map API provides for realtime information for mapping and places.
